# Yaapu Frsky Telemetry script

A lua based telemetry script for the Taranis X9D+,X9E and X7 radio using the frsky passthrough protocol.

The script supports all of the telemetry DIY 0x5000 packets sent by ardupilotâ€™s [frsky passthrough protocol library](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/tree/master/libraries/AP_Frsky_Telem)

Requires OpenTX 2.2 and a recent release of arducoper, arduplane or rover.

Tested on a pixracer with copter 3.5.3 and on a pixhawk clone with copter 3.5.4 and 3.5.5

## Voltage Sources

Battery voltage is tracked independentely for 3 battery sources: FLVSS, analog port A2 and flight controller. (The script can also use the A2 analog voltage source from X4R and X6R receivers, a2 would be displayed next to cell voltage). A short press of [ENTER] cycles between all the sources. Min value is also tracked for the 3 sources and can be shown with a [MENU] short press.

If you use a second FLVSS voltage sensor the OpenTX variable has to be renamed to "Cel2"

When a second battery is detected the script also tracks "aggregate" battery values and shows a "B1+B2" label in the right panel. Cell value and battery voltage is the "minimum" between the two batteries, current is summed and capacity percent is averaged. A short press of [MENU] will show min/max values for this aggregate view.

A short press of [ENTER] switches from single aggregate view to individual dual battery view. Subsequent short presses of [ENTER] in this dual view will cycle between voltage sources. In dual view a short press of [MENU] shows individual packs min/max values.

To get back to aggregate view short press [EXIT].

## Cell Count Detection

The script uses a simple way to calculate cell count for voltage sources fc and a2:
- if the maximum pack voltage is higher then 21.75v i.e 4.35x5 then it's a 6s.
- if the maximum pack voltage is higher then 17.4v i.e 4.35x4 then it's a 5s.
- if the maximum pack voltage is higher then 13.05v i.e 4.35x3 then it's a 4s.
- if the maximum pack voltage is higher then 8.7v i.e 4.35x2 then it's a 3s.
- else it's a 2s

This in turn means that:
- if you hook a 6s with cell voltage lower then 3.625V it will be detected as a 5s.
- if you hook a 5s with cell voltage lower then 3.48V it will be detected as a 4s.
- if you hook a 4s with cell voltage lower then 3.27V it will be detected as a 3s.

For 3s and 2s the limit is so low that's not a problem.

Please note that the voltage used for the calculation is the maximum pack voltage so if after detection the cell voltage lowers below the above limits it will be ok.

## Alerts

There are 2 battery level alerts, both are set as cell voltage so independent from cell count.
When minimum cell voltage reaches the first level it will trigger a vocal alert and the V next to the cell voltage will start blinking.
Battery level 1 should be set higher then battery level 2.
When the cell voltage reaches the second battery level it will trigger a second vocal alert and the cell voltage will start blinking.
If the battery reaches the failsafe level (it must be configured in mission planner) the script will display "batt failsafe" on the hud and play a vocal alert every n seconds (period can be configured from the menu).

It's also possible to configure a timer that will trigger a vocal alert every n minutes of flight time.

The script also support a "vocal fence" feature by setting a minimun altitude, a maximum altitude and a maximum distance alert.
When the vehicle moves outside of the fence the script will play a vocal alert every n seconds.

## Script timing and rates

- The script processes telemetry up to 60Hz
- Sport telemetry stream is at around 40Hz
- Screen is redrawn at 20Hz
- VSpd sensor is exposed to OpenTX at 20Hz
- All other frsky sensors are exposed to OpenTX at 4Hz
- Events and alarms are checked at 2Hz

## Configuration

![X7 menu](https://github.com/yaapu/FrskyTelemetryScript/blob/master/IMAGES/x7menupag2.png)

The language of the vocal alerts is independent from the radio language and can be configured from the menu.
Right now only english, italian and french are supported but new languages can be added with ease.

Battery capacity for battery 1 and battery 2 is automatically read from the values configured in mission planner but can both be overidden from the menu. When a new capacity is defined from the menu it will immediately be used in all calculations and it's value will be displayed on screen.

## Installation

Copy the contents of the SD folder to your radio SD Card.
Make sure to have the SOUNDS/yaapu0 and MODELS/yaapu folders.

For the X9D/X9D+ and X9E use the yaapu9.lua script.
For the QX7 radio use the yaapu7.lua script.

The script is quite big and compilation on your radio may fail.
The safest way is to compile it on Companion and then copy the .luac compiled version to the SD card in the /SCRIPTS/TELEMETRY folder.
I do provide already compiled versions for both X9D and QX7.

**Note: On radios without the luac option enabled it is necessary to rename the script from yaapu9.luac to yaapu9.lua and from yaapu7.luac to yaapu7.lua**

To enable sound files playback copy them to /SOUNDS/yaapu0/en and /SOUNDS/yaapu0/it folders.

## Compilation

In order to compile your own version you must first preprocess the SOURCES/yaapu0.lua script with the pproc.lua preprocessor.
Details on the preprocessor can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/incinirate/d52e03f453df94a65e1335d9c36d114e)

There are many #define each activates a specific feature of the script.
The most important ones are X9/X7 to build for different radio models.

You need a working lua interpreter for this to work.
On a command line simply run "lua pproc.lua yaapu0.lua yaapu9.lua"
The yaapu9.lua script is now ready to be compiled in Companion.
